	\begin{frame}[t]{What is Plasma ?}
       Plasma is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, distinct from solid, liquid, and gas. It is an \textbf{ionized gas} composed of positively charged ions and free electrons.

			\begin{bee}[Only gas ?]{white}{arsenic}
				No, Plasma is any matter thatâ€™s ionized, and for solids such as a metal that usually means very high temperatures.

	\begin{frame}[t]{Formation of Plasma}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Plasma is often formed through the process of {\color{magenta}ionization}.
		\item	At high temperatures, atoms gain enough energy to overcome the electrostatic forces holding electrons in their orbits around the nucleus.

		\item 	As a result, electrons are stripped away from the atoms, leading to the formation of positively charged ions and free electrons.
		\item {\color{red} High temperatures, electric discharges, or strong electromagnetic fields} can cause ionization.

\section{MHD and Plasma}
\begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{MHD and Plasma}
	The study of plasma in the context of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) involves understanding the behavior of ionized gases (plasma) in the presence of magnetic fields. Let's explore the detailed theory and concepts related to plasma and magnetohydrodynamics: \\
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\subsection{Basic MHD Equations}
		\item \textbf{Basic MHD Equations:} The fundamental MHD equations describe the behavior of plasma in the presence of magnetic fields. These equations include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			\item \textbf{Continuity Equation:} Describes the conservation of mass in a fluid, including a term for the movement of charged particles in the plasma.

		\item	\textbf{Momentum Equation:} Combines fluid dynamics with electromagnetic forces, accounting for the interaction between the fluid motion and magnetic fields.

		\item	\textbf{	Induction Equation:}Describes the evolution of magnetic fields in the plasma, taking into account the motion of the conducting fluid.

		\item	\textbf{	Energy Equation:}Incorporates energy transfer mechanisms, including heating and cooling processes, in the presence of magnetic fields.

		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Magnetic Confinement}
		\item	\textbf{Magnetic Confinement:} MHD plays a central role in the design and operation of magnetic confinement devices, where the goal is to confine and \framebreak control the hot plasma. \\
		By using strong magnetic fields, MHD helps prevent the
		 plasma from dissipating and losing heat, allowing it to reach the required conditions for nuclear fusion. \\
		Examples of magnetic confinement systems include
				\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak}{\underline{tokamaks}}, which use toroidal magnetic fields, and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator}{\underline{stellarators}}, which have more complex, three-dimensional magnetic field configurations.

	}

\end{columns}

		\subsection{Plasma as a Conductive Medium}
	\item	\textbf{	Plasma as a Conductive Medium:} In MHD, plasma is considered a conductive medium due to the presence of charged particles (ions and electrons). The behavior of the plasma is influenced by its electrical conductivity, which is much higher than that of non-ionized gases.

	\subsection{Nuclear Fusion Research}
	\item	\textbf{	Nuclear Fusion Research:} One of the primary applications of MHD is in the field of nuclear fusion. In the quest for controlled nuclear fusion, MHD principles are crucial for maintaining and controlling the hot, ionized gas (plasma) at the high temperatures and pressures required for fusion reactions.

	 Devices like tokamaks and stellarators use magnetic fields to confine and stabilize the plasma,\framebreak preventing it from touching the walls of the containment vessel and facilitating controlled fusion reactions.
		\subsection{Astrophysical Applications}
		\item	\textbf{Astrophysical Applications:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\textbf{Solar Wind:}MHD principles are applied to understand the  behavior of the solar wind, which consists of charged particles streaming from the Sun.

			\item	\textbf{	Stellar Magnetic Fields:}MHD is used to model the generation and evolution of magnetic fields in stars, influencing their structure and activity.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Space Propulsion}
	\item	\textbf{	Space Propulsion:} MHD principles are applied in the development of electric propulsion systems for space exploration.
	\framebreak
	Ion thrusters, which use electrically charged particles (often xenon ions) as propellant, leverage MHD concepts to ionize and accelerate the propellant using magnetic and electric fields. This technology provides efficient and long-duration thrust compared to traditional chemical rockets.\\
